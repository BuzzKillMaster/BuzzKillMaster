### Crafting Digital Experiences with a Hint of Madne... Magic! Definitely Magic.

Hi there! I'm Christian - a designer and developer fueled by curiosity and a love for crafting digital experiences. While I'm not claiming to be the next tech wizard, I do take pride in stretching my skills and pushing my own limits. Every line of code and design element is a step in my journey of continuous learning and improvement.

***Fun Fact:** My code never contains any bugs. It just spontaneously develops new features. üï∂Ô∏è*

## My Skill Set üõ†Ô∏è

### Proficient
- **React & Next.js**: Skillfully creating dynamic web experiences.
- **TypeScript**: Enhancing JavaScript projects with strong typing.
- **TailwindCSS**: Designing sleek, responsive interfaces with ease.

### Intermediate
- **React Native & Expo**: Building and experimenting with mobile apps.
- **Python & FastAPI**: Developing efficient, scalable back-end solutions.

### Growing
- **PostgreSQL**: Delving into the world of databases.
- **Server Maintenance & Linux CLI**: Steadily mastering server and command-line operations.
- **And More**: Eagerly exploring and expanding my technical horizons.

## On the Horizon üåÖ

üöÄ **Upcoming Ventures:**
- **Backend as a Service (BaaS) Project**: Crafting a BaaS with seamless management across implementations such as database, object storage, and content management. This venture is polishing my skills in Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, and MinIO. It's not just about building a system that works; it's about patching up annoyances and caveats that I've faced with existing services. And yes, there's a bit of homebrewed server magic in the mix!

- **Meditation App with AI-Generated Content**: Diving into the tranquil world of meditation apps, this project is a blend of React Native magic and AI wonder, using OpenAI and ElevenLabs. It's a journey through mindfulness, enhanced by technology, and a testament to the power of integrating self-developed tools into my own daily routines.

- **ASCIITAR - Avatar in ASCII Art**: A whimsical fusion of tech and fandom, turning the beloved "Avatar: The Last Airbender" show into ASCII art. It's more than just a small hobby project; it's a reminder that programming is an art form that brings joy to both the creator and the audience. *Exciting News: ASCIITAR is now live! Dive into this ASCII adventure at [asciitar.com](https://asciitar.com) and experience the magic for yourself!*

Each project is a step in my journey, blending skill development with a dash of personal passion. Stay tuned for more updates and unveilings!


## Achievements & Certifications üéì

My journey in tech is marked by continuous learning, culminating in the [Meta Generalist Software Engineer Certificate](https://www.credly.com/badges/3588eceb-e225-40f7-87ac-35ae0264cba6/public_url). This title was the result of completing a series of focused certifications, each contributing to my broad skill set:

- **Meta Front-End Developer**: Deepened my expertise in React and other front-end technologies.
- **Meta Back-End Developer**: Explored Django and Jupyter Notebooks, though my main focus shifted more towards FastAPI and automation of tasks.
- **Meta Database Engineer**: Where I honed my skills with databases, mainly MySQL, and gave me an understanding of database technologies and methodologies.
- **Meta Android Developer & iOS Developer**: Introduced me to Kotlin and Swift, but the emphasis was on React Native. While Kotlin was enjoyable, I'm more at home with JavaScript-based technologies.

Aside from these certifications, I've graduated as a Multimedia Designer, a milestone that has greatly shaped my approach and understanding of the digital world.

While I've dabbled in various technologies like Kotlin, Swift, Django, and Jupyter Notebooks, my comfort zone and daily toolkit primarily involve front-end technologies and related frameworks, with a little bit of Python sprinkled in for those pesky tasks that I can't be bothered to do complete manually and when building out the API for the previously mentioned BaaS. Each step, whether a deep dive or a brief exploration, has been a valuable addition to my journey and allows me to better understand the intricacies of different platforms and languages, as well as the people who work with them.

## Personal Growth üå±

Beyond the world of code, I'm on a journey of self-improvement that I believe makes me a better developer. 

- **Healthy Living**: Embracing exercise and healthier eating habits, because a healthy body fosters a sharp mind.
- **Language Learning**: Improving my Spanish, diving deeper into the beauty of languages and cultures - and allowing me to communicate with more potential customers!
- **Mindfulness**: Exploring meditation, finding balance between the digital and natural worlds.
- **Kicking the Coffee Habit**: Trading caffeine for more sustainable energy sources.

Each of these steps is about nurturing a holistic lifestyle. I've found that taking care of myself physically, mentally, and emotionally not only enhances my personal life but also amplifies my creativity and productivity in coding. It's all about striking the right balance to keep the mind agile and the ideas flowing!
